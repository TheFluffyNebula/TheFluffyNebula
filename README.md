## Hi!

I'm Jason Yin, a student at North Carolina State University. I am interested in software engineering and artificial intelligence. Some things I like to do in my free time are competitive programming, running, and reading. 

Some things I'm working on right now include:
* Students Leading Collaborative Computing Education
  * 501(c)(3) nonprofit aiming to make technology more accessible!
* A ncroep project: 'marine renewable energy portfolio optimization'
* A 'tinder for music' app
